# listee-libs

## Overview
`listee-libs` is the public monorepo that hosts the Listee SDK packages. Each module is published under the `@listee/*` scope so downstream applications (API, web, CLI, MCP) can consume them independently. The initial release focuses on `@listee/db` (database access layer) and `@listee/auth` (token verification utilities), with `@listee/types` and other packages (`chat`, `ui`, `sdk`) landing incrementally.

## Repository Layout
- `packages/<name>` — Individual packages with their implementation in `src/` and compiled output in `dist/`.
- `tsconfig.json` — Shared TypeScript project references and strict compiler requirements.
- `biome.json` — Biome formatter and linter configuration.
- `vitest.config.ts` — Test runner configuration for the entire workspace.
- `.github/workflows/` — CI pipelines based on `listee-dev/listee-ci@v1` workflows.

## Getting Started
1. Install Bun `1.2.22` (or later). We recommend pinning via `"packageManager": "bun@1.2.22"` in the root package.json for reproducibility.
2. Run `bun install` at the repository root (catalog-aware installation for every workspace).
3. Use `bun run lint`, `bun run build`, and `bun run test` to verify changes locally.
4. Initialize Changesets with `bun run changeset init` if you are bootstrapping a fresh clone.

## Packages

### `@listee/db`
- Provides a thin Postgres + Drizzle ORM layer with connection caching for local development.
- Requires `POSTGRES_URL` to be defined before calling `createPostgresConnection`.
- Exposes helpers:
  - `createPostgresConnection` — returns a cached `postgres` client (disabled in production); accepts optional overrides.
  - `db` — shared `drizzle-orm` database instance backed by the cached connection.
  - `createRlsClient`/`createDrizzle` — wrap transactions with Supabase-style RLS claims and role switching.
- Publishes generated types alongside compiled output (`sideEffects: false` for optimal tree-shaking).
- Ships with Bun-based unit tests (`packages/db/src/index.test.ts`) that mock `postgres`/`drizzle-orm`. Run `bun test` from the repo root to execute them.

### `@listee/auth`
- Exposes reusable authentication providers under `packages/auth/src/authentication/`.
- `createHeaderAuthentication` performs lightweight header extraction suitable for development stubs.
- `createSupabaseAuthentication` validates Supabase-issued JWT access tokens against the project's JWKS (`/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`), enforces issuer/audience/role constraints, and returns a typed `SupabaseToken` payload.
- Shared utilities (`shared.ts`, `errors.ts`) handle predictable error surfaces; tests live beside the implementation (`supabase.test.ts`) and exercise positive/negative paths.
- The package emits declarations from `src/` only; test files are excluded from `dist/` via `tsconfig.json`.

## Contribution Notes
- Follow the guidance in `AGENTS.md` for agent automation workflows and repository conventions.
- Keep documentation and code comments in English.
- Coordinate feature work through focused branches (`feature/...`, `chore/...`, etc.) and submit PRs with clear descriptions, linked issues, and test evidence.

## Architecture Guidelines

### Responsibility Boundaries
- `routes` only depend on `queries`, translate the return values into HTTP responses, and decide status codes.
- `queries` orchestrate the necessary `services` and `repositories` for each use case and accept dependencies via factories so they remain easy to test.
- `services` may depend on `repositories` (never the other way around). When a service grows large, consider moving domain logic under a dedicated `domain/` module and keeping application services thin.
- `repositories` sit at the bottom layer and encapsulate external SDK calls, SQL, or KV access. They should return plain TypeScript/domain types (`string`, `Date`, structured objects) to upstream layers.

### Dependency Flow
Keep a single direction: `routes → queries → (services → repositories)`. With the stack arranged this way you can reuse everything below `queries` across different runtimes (e.g., Cloudflare Workers) and mock each layer in isolation during tests.

### Authentication vs Authorization
- Treat authentication (identifying who the caller is) and authorization (deciding what that caller may do) as separate concerns under the `auth` package.
- Place authentication adapters in `packages/auth/src/authentication/` and expose helpers such as `getAuthenticatedUser(request)` so each runtime can plug in its own token/session verification.
- Organize authorization policies under `packages/auth/src/authorization/` with domain-specific modules (e.g., `policies/chat.ts` providing `canAccessChat`). Policies may declare repository interfaces that the application injects, keeping policy evaluation independent from data fetching details.
- The recommended execution order for an authenticated endpoint is `Route Handler → Authentication → Queries → Authorization → Services/Repositories`. Queries receive the authenticated actor (for example, via context) and call the relevant authorization policy before touching domain services.

## Release Process
Changesets drive versioning and publishing.

1. Run `bun run changeset` for every meaningful change. Select the affected packages and bump type, then commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` file.
2. When the Changeset PR merges to `main`, the CI pipeline creates a “Version Packages” PR. Merge it to stage versions.
3. A second merge to `main` triggers the `release` job. Approve the `production` environment gate in Actions to publish to npm.
4. Verify the published versions with `npm view @listee/<package> version` and update release notes as needed.

### Trusted Publishing requirements
- Each package `package.json` must declare:
  ```json
  "publishConfig": { "access": "public", "provenance": true },
  "repository": { "type": "git", "url": "https://github.com/listee-dev/listee-libs.git" }
  ```
- npm must grant Trusted Publisher access to `listee-dev/listee-libs` (workflow `ci.yml`, environment `production`). No permanent `NPM_TOKEN` is required.
- The reusable `release.yml` from `listee-ci` uses `npx changeset version/publish` with npm@latest, so local releases can be simulated via `npx changeset version && npx changeset publish`.
